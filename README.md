# Charity-Chain
A Decentralised solution to the corruption problem in the Donations which allow donors to track the donation and increase their trust in charities 
Running Charity-chain using embark:

Step 1: Go to the folder "Charity-chain" and open the terminal.
Step 2: Run the project using the command "embark run".

Step 3: Open two browser windows, and point them both to http://localhost:8000. In one window, select the account used to create an account already. If you haven't already created a user, select an account and create a new user. Do the same in the second browser window, but select a different account.

You should have two different user accounts.
Example : User1 is a charity organization eg. HelpAge India.
User2 is a person who wants to donate for the cause eg. Siri.

In the first window (signed in as HelpAge India), type Siri in to the search, and press enter.
In the second window (signed in as Siri), type HelpAge India in to the search, and press enter.
